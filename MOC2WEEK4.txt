District 20, like other districts, uses attendance zones. These are areas for determine which student goes where. For example, both Rampart and Air Academy high schools can each hold about 1,300 students. So, we need to draw boundaries so that students can go to a nearby school, without overloading one or the other. So, 2,000 at Air Academy, but only 800 at Rampart. These zones change a bit over time as needed. When one area of town has a spike in population. But these zones remain more or less the same across multiple years.
