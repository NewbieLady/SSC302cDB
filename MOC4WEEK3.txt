The County Shelter has been one of the most important places for animal welfare in the region for fifty years. For fifty years, the shelter has saved animal lives and improved human lives. To date, the shelter has placed a quarter of a million dogs and cats in happy homes. I bet almost everyone here tonight has had a dog or cat from this shelter. They have shaped our families. Our lives.  The County Shelter isn’t just a responsible steward of the local animal population. They are the invaluable. They make our lives better and our families complete.
